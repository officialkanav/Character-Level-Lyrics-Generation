\\'cause they don\\'t know shit about this \\n For the 9-6 \\n Ayo, my pen and paper cause a chain reaction \\n To get your brain relaxin, \\'cause they be actin\\' maniac in action \\n A brainiac in fact son, you mainly lack attraction \\n You looking zany whack with just a fraction of my tracks spun \\n My rhyming skills got you climbing hills \\n I travel through your mind into your spine like siren drills \\n I\\'m sliming grills of roaches, with sprayed on disinfectants \\n Twistin necks of rappers till their spinal column disconnects \\n Put this in decks and check the monologue, turn your system up \\n Twist them up, and indulge in the marijuana smog \\n This is the season for noise pollution contamination \\n Examination of more cartoons than animation \\n My lamination of narration \\n Hit\\'s a snare and bass in the track fucked up rapper interrogation \\n When I declare invasion, there ain\\'t no time to be staring, gazing \\n I turn the stage into a barren wasteland... \\n I\\'m Infinite \\n You heard of hell well I was sent from it \\n I went to it serving a sentence for murdering instruments \\n Now I\\'m trying to repent from it \\n But when I hear the beat I\\'m tempted to make another attempt at it... \\n I\\'m Infinite \\n Bust it, I let the beat commence so I can beat the sense in your elite defense \\n I got some meat to mince, a crew to stomp and then two feet to rinse \\n I greet the gents and ladies, I spoil all your fans \\n I foil plans and leave fluids leaking like oil pans \\n My coiled hands around this microphone are lethal \\n One thought in my cerebral is deeper then a Jeep full of people \\n MC\\'s are feeble, I came to cause some pandemonium \\n Battle a band of phony MC\\'s and stand the lonely one \\n Imitator, Intimidator, Stimulator, Simulator of data, Eliminator \\n There\\'s never been a greater since the burial of Jesus \\n Fuck around and catch all of the venereal diseases \\n My thesis will smash a stereo to pieces \\n My accapella releases plastic masterpieces through telekinesis \\n That eases you mentally, gently, sentimentally, instrumentally \\n With entity, dementedly meant to be Infinite \\n You heard of hell well I was sent from it \\n I went to it serving a sentence for murdering instruments \\n Now I\\'m trying to repent from it \\n But when I hear the beat I\\'m tempted to make another attempt at it... \\n I\\'m Infinite \\n Man I got evidence I\\'m never dense and I been clever ever since \\n My residence was hesitant to do some shit that represents the M-O \\n So I\\'m assuming all responsibility \\n Cause there\\'s a monster will in me that always wants to kill MC\\'s \\n Mic messaler, slamming like a wrestler \\n Here to make a mess of a lyric smuggling embezzler \\n No one is speacialer, My skill is intergalactical \\n I get cynical act a fool then I send a crew back to school \\n I never packed a tool or acted cool, it wasn\\'t practical \\n I\\'d rather let a tactical, tactful, track tickle your fancy \\n In fact I can\\'t see, or can\\'t imagine \\n A man who ain\\'t a lover of beats or a fan of scratching \\n This is for my family, the kid who had a cameo on my last jam \\n Plus the man who never had a plan B \\n Be all you can be, cause once you make an instant hit \\n I\\'m tensed a bit and tempted when I see the sins my friends commit... \\n I\\'m Infinite \\n You heard of hell well I was sent from it \\n I went to it serving a sentence for murdering instruments \\n Now I\\'m trying to repent from it \\n But when I hear the beat I\\'m tempted to make another attempt at it... \\n I\\'m Infinite \\n You heard of hell well I was sent from it \\n I went to it serving a sentence for murdering instruments \\n Now I\\'m trying to repent

day, coming up next \\n It\\'s a local 313 talent \\n He goes by the name of Eminem \\n And it\\'s called \" \\n It\\'s OK \\n \" \\n Check it out\\n Eye-Kyu: Check it out, \\n Eminem: Hey Kyu! \\n Eye-Kyu: \\n Chorus: It\\'s a broke day but everything is ok (It\\'s ok) \\n I\\'m up all night, but everything is all right (It\\'s all right) \\n It\\'s a rough week, and I don\\'t get enough sleep (I can\\'t sleep) \\n It\\'s a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here) \\n It\\'s a broke day but everything is ok (It\\'s ok) \\n I\\'m up all night, but everything is all right (It\\'s all right) \\n It\\'s a rough week, and I don\\'t get enough sleep (I can\\'t sleep) \\n It\\'s a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here) \\n Verse 1: Eminem \\n One day I plan to be a family man happily married \\n I wanna grow to be so old that I have to be carried \\n Till I\\'m glad to be buried \\n And leave this crazy world \\n And have at least a half a million for my baby girl \\n It may be early to be planning this stuff \\n \\'Cause I\\'m still struggling hard to be the man, and it\\'s tough \\n Cause man it\\'s been rough, but still I manage enough \\n I\\'ve been taken advantage of, damaged and scuffed \\n My hands have been cuffed \\n But I don\\'t panic and huff, frantic and puff \\n Or plan to give up, the minute shit hits the fan it erupts \\n I\\'m anteing up double or nothing, I\\'ve been trouble enough \\n And I\\'m sick of struggling and suffering, see \\n My destiny\\'s to rest at ease, till I\\'m impressed and pleased \\n With my progress, I won\\'t settle for less than cheese \\n I\\'m on a quest to seize all, my own label to call \\n Way before my baby is able to crawl \\n I\\'m too stable to fall, the pressure motivates \\n To know I hold the weight of boulders on my shoulder blades \\n I seen the golden gates to heaven on Earth \\n Where they don\\'t pull a weapon on you when you stepping on turf, Q \\n Eye-Kyu: \\n Chorus: It\\'s a broke day but everything is ok (It\\'s ok) \\n I\\'m up all night, but everything is all right (It\\'s all right) \\n It\\'s a rough week, and I don\\'t get enough sleep (I can\\'t sleep) \\n It\\'s a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here) \\n It\\'s a broke day but everything is ok (It\\'s ok) \\n I\\'m up all night, but everything is all right (It\\'s all right) \\n It\\'s a rough week, and I don\\'t get enough sleep (I can\\'t sleep) \\n It\\'s a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here) \\n Verse 2: Eminem \\n I\\'m going for broke, gambling and playing for keeps \\n Everyday in the streets, scrambling and paying for cheap \\n Praying for sleep \\n Dreaming with a watering mouth \\n Wishing for a better life for my daughter and spouse \\n In this slaughtering house, caught up in bouts \\n With the root of all evil \\n I\\'ve seen it turn beautiful people crude and deceitful \\n And make them do shit illegal \\n For these Grant\\'s and Jackson\\'s \\n These transactions explain a man\\'s actions \\n But in the mist of this insanity, I found my Christianity \\n Through God and there\\'s a wish he granted me \\n He showed me how to cope with the stress \\n And hope for the best, instead of mope and depressed \\n Always groping a mess, of flying over the nest \\n To selling dope with the rest \\n I quit smoking cess to open my chest \\n Life is stressful inside this

thing I learned \\n They\\'re only powerful when you got your back turned \\n I yearned for the day that we finally met again \\n So I can give him a taste of his own medicine \\n He shed his skin, then he promised to come clean \\n I took his butcher knife and jabbed it into his spleen \\n Cut him at the seam then dragged the fella home \\n Beating him over the head with the telephone \\n Police voice: \\n Attention all cars, attention all cars \\n Unit 313 has apprehended the suspect \\n He\\'s going back to the crazy home, I repeat \\n He\\'s going back to the crazy home, how about that? \\n I make you think you\\'re a best friend then \\n Why I oughtta \\n Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you\\'re a best friend then \\n Why I oughtta \\n Stay away from him he ain\\'t no good! \\n I make you think you\\'re a best friend then \\n Why I oughtta \\n Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you\\'re a best friend then \\n Why I oughtta \\n Stay away from him he ain\\'t no good! \\n I make you think you\\'re a best friend then \\n Why I oughtta \\n Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you\\'re a best friend then \\n Why I oughtta \\n

out with Pneumonia ( \\n He\\'s got AIDS \\n ) \\n Good luck Mr. Shady \\n Hi there, little boys and girls ( \\n Fuck you \\n ) \\n Today we\\'re going to learn how to poison squirrels \\n But first I\\'d like you to meet my friend Bob ( \\n Huh? \\n ) \\n Say hi Bob (Hi Bob), Bob\\'s 30 and still lives with his mom \\n He don\\'t got a job cause Bob sits at home and smokes pot \\n But his 12 year old brother looks up to him an awful lot \\n And Bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot \\n And wait in the parking lot for waitresses off the clock \\n When it\\'s late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog \\n Drag \\'em in the woods and goes straight to the chopping block \\n And even if they escaped and they got the cops \\n The ladies would all be just so afraid they\\'d drop the charge \\n Till one night Mrs. Stacy went off the job \\n When she felt someone grab hold of her face and said not to talk \\n But Stacy knew it was Bob and said knock it off \\n But Bob wouldn\\'t knock it off \\'cause he\\'s crazy and off his rocker \\n Crazy good as Slim Shady is off the block, uh \\n You couldn\\'t even take him to \\n Dre\\'s \\n to give Bob a doctor \\n Grabbed Stacy by the legs and chopped them off her \\n And dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her \\n But ever since the day Stacy went off to wander they never found her \\n And Bob still hangs at the waffle diner \\n And that\\'s the story of Bob and his marijuana and what it might do to you \\n So see if the squirrels want it, it\\'s bad for you \\n Mr. Mackey impersonation (Eminem) \\n : \\n See children, drugs are bad (come on) \\n And if you don\\'t believe me ask your dad (raise your hand) \\n And if you don\\'t believe him ask your mom (that\\'s right) \\n She\\'ll

(sing along) \\n Drugs are just bad, m\\'kay \\n My penis is the size of a peanut, have you seen it \\n Fuck no you ain\\'t seen it, it\\'s the size of a peanut (huh?) \\n Speaking of peanuts, you know what else is bad for squirrels \\n Ecstasy, it\\'s the worst drug in the world \\n If someone ever offers it to you, don\\'t do it \\n Kids, two hits\\'ll probably drain all your spinal fluid \\n And spinal fluid is final, you won\\'t get it back \\n So don\\'t get attached it\\'ll attack every bone in your back \\n Meet Zach, 21 years old \\n After hanging out with some friends at a frat party, he gets bold \\n And decides to try five when he\\'s bribed by five guys \\n And peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it \\n Suddenly, he starts to convulse, and his pulse \\n Goes into hyperdrive, and his eyes roll back in his skull \\n His back arches up, looks like the McDonalds arches \\n He\\'s on Donald\\'s carpet, layin\\' horizontal barfin\\' \\n And everyone in the apartment starts laughin\\' at him \\n \"Hey Adam, Zach is a jackass, look at him.\" \\n \\'Cause they took it too, so they think it\\'s funny \\n So they\\'re laughing at basically nothing, except maybe wasting their money \\n Meanwhile Zach\\'s in a coma, the action is over \\n And his back and his shoulders hunched up like he\\'s practicing yoga \\n And that\\'s the story of Zach: the ecstasy maniac \\n So don\\'t even feed that to squirrels class, \\'cause it\\'s bad for you \\n Mr. Mackey impersonation (Eminem) \\n : \\n See children, drugs are bad (that\\'s right) \\n And if you don\\'t believe me ask your dad (that\\'s right) \\n And if you don\\'t believe him ask your mom (you can) \\n She\\'ll tell you how she does him all the time (she will) \\n So kids say no to drugs (smoke

\\n There\\'s no control, he just lets his emotions go \\n (Chorus from \\n Aerosmith \\n \\'s \\n Dream On \\n ) \\n (Come on!) \\n Sing with me, \\n (Sing!) \\n for the year \\n (Sing it!) \\n For the laughter, sing for the tear \\n (Come on!) \\n Sing it with me, if it\\'s just for today \\n Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away \\n Entertainment is changin\\', intertwinin\\' with gangstas \\n In the land of the killers, a sinner\\'s mind is a sanctum \\n Holy or unholy, only have one homie \\n Only this gun, lonely \\'cause don\\'t anyone know me \\n Yet everybody just feels like they can relate \\n I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great \\n Or they can degrade, or even worse they can teach hate \\n It\\'s like these kids hang on every single statement we make \\n Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum \\n Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen \\n From standin\\' on corners and porches just rappin\\' \\n To havin\\' a fortune, no more kissin\\' ass \\n But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you \\n Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you \\n To get they hands on every dime you have \\n They want you to lose your mind every time you mad \\n So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon \\n Any dispute won\\'t hesitate to produce handguns \\n That\\'s why these prosecutors wanna convict me \\n Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly \\n But all they kids be listenin\\' to me religiously \\n So I\\'m signin\\' CDs while police fingerprint me \\n They\\'re for the judge\\'s daughter but his grudge is against me \\n If I\\'m such a fuckin\\' menace, this shit doesn\\'t make sense B \\n It\\'s all political, if my music is literal \\n And I\\'m a criminal how the fuck can I raise a little girl \\n I couldn\\'t, I wouldn\\'t be fit to \\n You\\'re full of shit too, Guerrera, that was a fist that hit you \\n (Come on!) \\n Sing with me, (Sing!) for the year (Sing that shit!) \\n For the laughter, sing for the tears (Sing with me!) \\n Sing it with me, if it\\'s just for today \\n Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away \\n They say music can alter moods and talk to you \\n Well can it load a gun up for you and cock it too \\n Well if it can, then the next time you assault a dude \\n Just tell the judge it was my fault and I\\'ll get sued \\n See what these kids do is hear about us totin\\' pistols \\n And they want to get one \\'cause they think the shit\\'s cool \\n Not knowin\\' we really just protectin\\' ourselves, we entertainers \\n Of course the shit\\'s affectin\\' our sales, you ignoramus \\n But music is reflection of self, we just explain it \\n And then we get our checks in the mail, it\\'s fucked up ain\\'t it \\n How we can come from practically nothing \\n To being able to have any fuckin\\' thing that we wanted \\n That\\'s why we sing for these kids who don\\'t have a thing \\n Except for a dream, and a fuckin\\' rap magazine \\n Who post pin-up pictures on their walls all day long \\n Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs \\n Or for anyone who\\'s ever been through shit in they lives \\n Till they sit and they cry at night, wishin\\' they\\'d die \\n Till they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe \\n We\\'re nothin\\' to you, but we\\'re the fuckin\\' shit in they eyes \\n That\\'s why we, seize the moment try to freeze it and own it \\n Squeeze it and hold it, \\'cause we consider these minutes golden \\n And maybe they\\'ll admit it when we\\'re gone just let our spirits live on \\n Through our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we can \\n Sing with me, \\n (Sing!) \\n for the year \\n (Sing it!) \\n For the laughter, sing for the tears \\n (Come on!) \\n Sing it with me, if it\\'s just for today \\n Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away \\n Sing with me, \\n (Sing!) \\n for the year \\n (Sing it!) \\n For the laughter, sing for the tears \\n (Come on!) \\n Sing it with me, if it\\'s just for today \\n Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away\\n Spoken \\n (Mmmhh) \\n You high baby?

bike \\n From somebody\\'s backyard \\n And drop it off at the park \\n That was the halfway mark \\n To meet Kim had to walk back to her momma\\'s and charmer\\'s \\n After dark to sneak me in the house \\n When I\\'m kicked out my mom\\'s \\n That\\'s about the time I first met Proof, we\\'d goof \\n He\\'d carry on the steps said I was bored handin\\' out some flyers \\n He was doin\\' some talent shows at Center Line High \\n I told him to stop by and check this out some time \\n He looked at me like I\\'m out my mind \\n Shook his head like white boys don\\'t know how to rhyme \\n I spit out a line and rhymed birthday with first place \\n And they both had the same rhymes that soundalike \\n We was on that same shit, that \\n Big Daddy Kane \\n shit \\n Where compound syllables sound combined \\n From that day we was down to ride \\n Somehow we knew we\\'d meet again somewhere down the line \\n So let\\'s go back \\n Follow the yellow brick road \\n As we go on another

done banned they shoes, \\n I had the new ones, the cool J, Ice-lambs, suede too. \\n But we just threw \\'em in the trash like they was yesterday\\'s news \\n Guess who came through next?

power and we ain\\'t know what it meant \\n Me and my man Howard and Butter, would go to the mall with \\'em \\n All over our necks like we\\'re showing \\'em off \\n Not knowing at all we was being laughed at you ain\\'t even half black \\n You ain\\'t supposed to have that homie let me grab that \\n And that Flavor Flave clock we gonna have to snatch that \\n All I remember is meeting back at \\n Manix\\'s basement, saying how we hate this, how racist but dope the x clan\\'s tape is... \\n Which reminds me back in 89 me and Kim broke up for the first time \\n She was tryna two time me \\n And there was this black girl \\n At our school who thought I was cool cause I rapped so she was kinda eyeing me \\n And oh the irony guess what her name was ain\\'t even gonna say it plus \\n The same color hair as hers was and blue contacts and a pair of jugs \\n The bombest goddamn girl in our whole school if I could pull it \\n Not only would I become more popular but I would be able to piss Kim off at the same time \\n But it backfired I was supposed to dump her \\n But she dumped me for this black guy \\n And thats the last I ever seen or heard or spoke to \\n The oh foolish pride girl \\n But I\\'ve heard people say they heard the tape and it ain\\'t that bad \\n But it was I singled out a whole race and for that apologize, I was wrong \\n \\'Cause no matter what color a girl is, she\\'s still a hoe \\n So let\\'s go back \\n Follow the yellow brick road \\n As we go on another episode \\n Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place \\n That I once used to call home sweet home \\n Come on, let\\'s go back \\n Follow the yellow brick road \\n As we go on another episode \\n Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place \\n That I once used to call home sweet home\\n Step by step, heart to heart, left right left \\n We all fall down... \\n Step by step, heart to heart, left right left \\n We all fall down like toy soldiers \\n Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win \\n But the battle wages on for toy soldiers \\n I\\'m supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure \\n Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders \\n I ain\\'t never supposed to show it, my crew ain\\'t supposed to know it \\n Even if it means goin\\' toe to toe with a \\n Benzino \\n it don\\'t matter \\n I\\'d never drag them in battles that I can handle unless I absolutely have to \\n I\\'m supposed to set an example \\n I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide \\'em \\n If some shit ever just pop off, I\\'m supposed to be beside \\'em \\n Now the \\n Ja \\n shit I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it \\n There\\'s a certain line you just don\\'t cross and he crossed it \\n I heard him say Hailie\\'s name on a song and I just lost it \\n It was crazy, this shit be way beyond some \\n Jay-Z \\n and \\n Nas \\n shit \\n And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it \\n I spent too much energy on it, honestly I\\'m exhausted \\n And I\\'m so caught in it I almost feel I\\'m the one who caused it \\n This ain\\'t what I\\'m in hip-hop for, it\\'s not why I got in it \\n That was never my object for someone to get killed \\n Why would I wanna destroy something I helped build? \\n It wasn\\'t my intentions, my intentions was good \\n I went through my whole career without ever mentionin\\' it \\n Now it\\'s just out of respect for not runnin\\' my mouth \\n And talkin\\' about something that I knew nothing about \\n Plus \\n Dre \\n told me stay out, this just wasn\\'t my beef \\n So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth \\n While he\\'s all over TV down talkin\\' a man \\n Who literally saved my life, like \"Fuck it, I understand\" \\n This is business and this shit just isn\\'t none of my business \\n But still knowin\\' this shit could pop off at any minute \\'cause \\n Step by step, heart to heart, left right left \\n We all fall down like toy soldiers \\n Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win \\n But the battle wages on for toy soldiers \\n There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme \\n And wouldn\\'t have to worry about one of your people dyin\\' \\n But now it\\'s elevated \\'cause once you put someone\\'s kids in it \\n The shit gets escalated, it ain\\'t just words no more is it? \\n It\\'s a different ball game, callin\\' names and you ain\\'t just rappin\\' \\n We actually tried to stop the \\n 50 \\n and Ja beef from happenin\\' \\n Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him \\n And asked him not to start it he wasn\\'t gonna go after him \\n Until Ja started yappin\\' in magazines how we stabbed him \\n Fuck it 50 smash \\'em, mash \\'em, and let him have it \\n Meanwhile my attention is pulled in another direction \\n Some receptionist at \\n The Source \\n who answers phones at his desk \\n Has an erection for me and thinks that I\\'ll be his resurrection \\n Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record \\n But now he\\'s fucked the game up \\'cause one of the ways I came up \\n Was through that publication, the same one that made me famous \\n Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin\\' \\n Well fuck it, that mutherfucker can get it too, fuck him then \\n When I\\'m so busy being pissed off I don\\'t stop to think \\n That we just inherited 50\\'s beef with Murder Inc. \\n And he\\'s inherited mine which is fine ain\\'t like either of us mind \\n We still have soldiers that\\'s on the front line \\n That\\'s willing to die for us as soon as we give the orders \\n Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us \\n We\\'ll maybe shout \\'em out in a rap or up in a chorus \\n To show them we love \\'em back and let \\'em know how important it is \\n To have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners \\n Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is \\n But I ain\\'t tryna have none of my people hurt or murdered \\n It ain\\'t worth it, I can\\'t think of a perfecter way to word it \\n Than to just say that I love ya\\'ll too much to see the verdict \\n I\\'ll walk away from it all before I let it go any further \\n But don\\'t get it twisted, it\\'s not a plea that I\\'m coppin\\' \\n I\\'m just willin\\' to be the bigger man if y\\'all can quit poppin\\' \\n Off at your jaws with the knockin\\' \\'cause frankly I\\'m sick of talkin\\' \\n I\\'m not gonna let someone else\\'s coffin rest on my conscience \\'cause \\n Step by step, heart to heart, left right left \\n We all fall down like toy soldiers \\n Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win \\n But the battle wages on for toy soldiers\\n I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America \\n And to the Republic for which it stands \\n One nation under God \\n Indivisible with liberty and justice for all \\n It feels so good to be back \\n I scrutinize every word, memorize every line \\n I spit it once, refuel, re-energize and rewind \\n I give sight to the blind, my insight through the mind \\n I exercise my right to express when I feel it\\'s time \\n It\\'s just all in your mind, what you interpret it as \\n I say to fight, you take it as I\\'mma whip someone\\'s ass \\n If you don\\'t understand, don\\'t even bother to ask \\n A father who has grown up with a fatherless past \\n Who has blown up now to rap phenomenon that has \\n Or at least shows no difficulty multi-task \\n And in juggling both perhaps mastered his craft \\n Slash entrepreneur who has helped launch a few more rap acts \\n Who\\'s had a few obstacles thrown his way through the last half \\n Of his career typical manure moving past that \\n Mr. kisses ass crack, he\\'s a class act \\n Rubber band man, yea he just snaps back \\n Come along, follow me as I lead through the darkness \\n As I provide just enough spark that we need to proceed \\n Carry on, give me hope, give me strength \\n Come with me and I won\\'t steer you wrong \\n Put your faith and your trust as I guide us through the fog \\n To the light at the end of the tunnel \\n We gonna fight, we gonna charge, we gonna stomp, we gonna march \\n Through the swamp, we gonna mosh through the marsh \\n Take us right through the doors, c\\'mon \\n All the people up top on the side and the middle \\n Come together lets all bomb and swamp just a little \\n Just let it gradually build from the front to the back \\n All you can see is a sea of people some white and some black \\n Don\\'t matter what color, all that matters we gathered together \\n To celebrate for the same \\'cause don\\'t matter the weather \\n If it rains let it rain, yeah the wetter the better \\n They ain\\'t gonna stop us they can\\'t, we stronger now more than ever \\n They tell us no we say yea, they tell us stop we say go \\n Rebel with a rebel yell, raise hell we gonna let \\'em know \\n Stomp, push, shove, mush, Fuck Bush \\n Until they bring our troops home, c\\'mon \\n Come along, follow me as I lead through the darkness \\n As I provide just enough spark that we need to proceed \\n Carry on, give me hope, give me strength \\n Come with me and I won\\'t steer you wrong \\n Put your faith and your trust as I guide us through the fog \\n To the light at the end of the tunnel \\n We gonna fight, we gonna charge, we gonna stomp, we gonna march \\n Through the swamp, we gonna mosh through the marsh \\n Take us right through the doors, c\\'mon \\n Imagine it pouring, it\\'s raining down on us \\n Mosh pits outside the oval office \\n Someone\\'s tryina tell us something \\n Maybe this is God just sayin\\' we\\'re responsible \\n For this monster, this coward that we have empowered \\n This is Bin Laden, look at his head noddin\\' \\n How could we allow something like this without pumping our fists \\n Now this is our final hour \\n Let me be the voice in your strength and your choice \\n Let me simplify the rhyme just to amplify the noise \\n Try to amplify the times it, and multiply by six- \\n Teen million people, Are equal at this high pitch \\n Maybe we can reach Al Queda through my speech \\n Let the president answer a higher anarchy \\n Strap him with an Ak-47, let him go, fight his own war \\n Let him impress daddy that way \\n No more blood for oil, we got our own battles to fight \\n On our own soil, no more psychological warfare \\n To trick us to thinking that we ain\\'t loyal \\n If we don\\'t serve our own country, we\\'re patronizing a hero \\n Look in his eyes its all lies \\n The stars and stripes, they\\'ve been swiped, washed out and wiped \\n And replaced with his own face, mosh now or die \\n If I get sniped tonight you know why, \\'cause I told you to fight \\n Come along, follow me as I lead through the darkness \\n As I provide just enough spark that we need to proceed \\n Carry on, give me hope, give me strength \\n Come with me and I won\\'t steer you wrong \\n Put your faith and your trust as I guide us through the fog \\n To the light at the end of the tunnel \\n We gonna fight, we gonna charge, we gonna stomp, we gonna march \\n Through the swamp, we gonna mosh through the marsh \\n Take us right through the doors, c\\'mon \\n And as we proceed to Mosh \\n Through this desert storm \\n In these closing statements, if they should argue \\n Let us beg to differ \\n As we set aside our differences \\n And assemble our own army \\n To disarm this Weapon of Mass Destruction \\n That we call our President, for the present \\n And Mosh for the future of our next generation \\n To speak and be heard \\n Mr. President, Mr. Senator \\n Do you guy\\'s hear us?\\n *Puking noises* \\n There I go \\n Thinking of you again \\n You don\\'t know how sick you make me \\n You make me fuckin\\' sick to my stomach \\n Every time I think of you, I puke \\n You must just not know-oh-oh-oh-ho \\n You may not think you do, but you do \\n Every time I think of you \\n I was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little poem \\n But off of the dome would probably be a little more \\n More suitable for this type of song, whoa \\n I got a million reasons off the top of my head that I could think of \\n Sixteen bars, this ain\\'t enough to put some ink ta \\n So fuck it, I\\'mma start right here by just be briefer \\n Bout to rattle off some other reasons \\n I knew I shouldn\\'t go and get another tattoo of you \\n On my arm, but what do I go and do \\n I go and get another one, now I got two \\n Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh \\n I\\'m sittin\\' here with your name on my skin \\n I can\\'t believe I went and did this stupid shit again \\n My next girlfriend, now her name\\'s gotta be Kim \\n Shi-ii-ii-ii-ii-ii-it \\n If you only knew how much I hated you \\n For every motherfuckin\\' thing you ever put us through \\n Then I wouldn\\'t be standing here crying over you \\n Boo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-hoo \\n You don\\'t know how sick you make me \\n You make me fuckin\\' sick to my stomach \\n Every time I think of you, I puke \\n You must just not know, whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa \\n You may not think you do, but you do \\n Every time I think of you \\n I was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little letter \\n But I thought a song would probably be a little better \\n Instead of a letter \\n That you\\'d probably just shred up, yeah \\n I stumbled on your picture yesterday and it made me stop and think of \\n How much of a waste it\\'d be for me to put some ink ta \\n A stupid piece a paper, I\\'d rather let you see how \\n Much I fuckin\\' hate you in a freestyle \\n You\\'re a fuckin\\' cokein\\' slut, I hope you fuckin\\' die \\n I hope you get to hell and Satan sticks a needle in your eye \\n I hate your fuckin\\' guts, you fuckin\\' slut, I hope you die \\n Di-ii-ii-ii-ii-ii-ie \\n But please don\\'t get me wrong, I\\'m not bitter or mad \\n It\\'s not that I still love you, it\\'s not \\'cause I want you back \\n It\\'s just that when I think of you, it makes me wanna yak \\n Aa-aa-aa-aa-aa-aa-ack \\n What else can I do, I haven\\'t got a clue? \\n Now I guess I\\'ll just move on, I have no choice but to \\n But every time I think of you now, I\\'ll I wanna do \\n Is pu-uu-uu-uu-uu-uu-uke \\n You don\\'t know how sick you make me \\n You make me fuckin\\' sick to my stomach \\n Every time I think of you, I puke \\n You must just not know, whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa \\n You may not think you do, but you do \\n Every time I think of you, I puke \\n *Puking noises* \\n Fuckin\\' bitch\\n My First Single \\n

Definitely, definitely, definitely dope. \\n Definitely, definitely K-Mart. \\n Yeah, yeah. \\n Eminem & \\n Dr. Dre \\n : \\n You find me offensive, I find you offensive for finding me offensive \\n Hence if I should draw out a line any fences, if so to what extents if \\n Any should I go, \\'cause it\\'s gettin\\' expensive \\n Being on the other side of the court room, on the defensive \\n They say I cause extensive, psychological nerve damage to the brain \\n When I go to lengths this far at other people\\'s expenses \\n I say you\\'re all just too goddamn sensitive \\n It\\'s censorship and it\\'s downright blasphemous \\n Let\\'s end this shit now, \\'cause I won\\'t stand for this \\n And \\n Christopher Reeves \\n won\\'t sit for this neither \\n And let\\'s clear this up too, I ain\\'t got no beef with him either \\n He used to be like a hero to me, I even believe I \\n Had one of those twenty-five cent stickers on my refrigerator \\n Right next to \\n Darth Vader \\n and Darth must have put a hex on him for later \\n I feel like it\\'s my fault, \\'cause of the way that \\n I stuck him off in between him and \\n Lex Luther \\n I killed Superman I killed Super-man and how ironic \\n That I\\'d be the bad guy \\n kryptonite \\n , the green chronic \\n \\'Cause I ain\\'t got no legs or no brain \\n Nice to meet you, hi my name is, I forgot my name \\n My aim was not to become, what I became with this level of fame \\n My soul is possessed by this devil, my new name is, Rain Man \\n Now in the bible it says, thou shall not watch two lesbians in bed \\n Have homosexual sex unless of course you were given the consent to join in \\n Then of course it\\'s intercourse and it\\'s bisexual sex \\n Which isn\\'t as bad, as long as you show some remorse for your actions \\n Either before during or after, performing the act of that which \\n Is normally referred to as such, more commonly known phrases \\n That are more used by today kids, in a more derogatory way \\n But who\\'s to say, what\\'s fair to say and what not to say, let\\'s ask Dr. Dre \\n Dr. Dre ( \\n What up? \\n ), I got a question if I may ( \\n Yeah \\n ) \\n Is it gay, to play putt putt golf with a friend ( \\n Yeah \\n ) \\n And watch his butt butt when he tees off ( \\n Yeah \\n ) \\n But but, I ain\\'t done yet \\n In football a quarterback yells out hut hut, while he reaches in another grown man\\'s ass \\n Grabs on his nuts, but just what if, it was never meant, it was just an accident \\n But he tripped fell slipped, and his penis went in, his teeny-tiny little round hiney \\n And he didn\\'t mean it but his little weenie flinched, just a little bit \\n And I don\\'t need to go into any more details but \\n What if he pictured it as a female\\'s butt \\n Is that gay, I just need to clear things up \\n Till then I\\'ll just walk around with a manly strut because \\n \\'Cause I ain\\'t got no legs, or no brain \\n Nice to meet you, hi my name is, I forgot my name \\n My aim was not to become, what I became with this level of fame \\n My soul is possessed by this devil, my new name is, Rain Man \\n You find me offensive, I find you offensive \\n Shit, this is the same verse, I just did this \\n When am I gonna come to my good senses \\n Probably the day \\n Bush \\n comes to my defenses \\n My spider sense is tellin\\' me \\n Spider-Man \\n is nearby \\n And my plan is to get him next, and open up a whoop ass canister \\n Goddammit Dre, where\\'s the goddamn beat ( \\n Yeah \\n ), anyway \\n Anyway, I don\\'t know how else to put it \\n This is the only thing that I\\'m good at \\n I am the bad guy kryptonite, the green chronic \\n Demonic, yep yep, don\\'t worry I\\'m on it \\n I got it, high-fived \\n Nick Lachey \\n Stuck a pin in \\n Jessica\\'s \\n head, and walked away \\n And as she flew around the room like a balloon I \\n Grabbed the last can of chicken tuna out the trash can, and zoom I \\n Headed straight back to the \\n Neverland Ranch \\n With a peanut butter jelly chicken tuna sandwich \\n And I ain\\'t even gotta make no goddamn sense \\n I just did a whole song and I didn\\'t say shit \\n \\'Cause I ain\\'t got no legs, or no brain \\n Nice to meet you, hi my name is, I forgot my name \\n My aim was not to become, what I became with this level of fame \\n My soul is possessed by this devil, my new name is, Rain Man \\n \\'Cause I-ahh ahh-ahh-ahh \\n Spoken \\n : \\n Yo, Rain Man. \\n Definitely, definitely Dr. Dre, super-dope beat maker, two thousand and... \\n Two thousand, four hundred and eighty seven million, nine hundred and seventy three thousand four hundred and sixty three... \\n And seventy. ( \\n Yeah \\n )\\n I don\\'t understand \\n Why are you being so mean? \\n You\\'re a mean, mean man \\n You\\'re just jealous of me \\n \\'Cause you, you just can\\'t do what I do \\n So instead of just admitting it \\n You walk around and say \\n All kinds of really mean things \\n About me \\'cause you\\'re a meanie, a meanie \\n But it\\'s only \\'cause you\\'re just really jealous of me \\n \\'Cause I\\'m what you want to be \\n So you just look like an idiot \\n When you say these mean things \\n \\'Cause it\\'s too easy to see \\n You\\'re really just a big weenie, big weenie \\n Alright, listen, I need you to focus \\n I need you to go dig deep in your mind, this is important \\n We are going to perform an experiment of the sorts \\n I\\'m going to have to ask you to bear with me for a moment \\n Now, I need you to open your mind; your eyes, close them \\n You are now about to be placed under my hypnosis \\n For the next four and a half minutes \\n We are going to explore into your mind \\n To find out why you\\'re so fucking jealous \\n Now, why did they make Yoo-hoo?

don\\'t give a damn \\n What you think, I\\'m doin\\' this for me, so fuck the world feed it beans \\n It\\'s gassed up, if it thinks it\\'s stoppin\\' me \\n I\\'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly \\n And all those who looked down on me, I\\'m tearin\\' down your balcony \\n No if ands or buts, don\\'t try to ask him why or how can he \\n From \\n Infinite \\n down to the last \\n Relapse \\n album, he\\'s still shittin\\' \\n Whether he\\'s on salary, paid hourly \\n Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him \\n Whichever comes first, for better or worse \\n He\\'s married to the game, like a \"fuck you\" for Christmas \\n His gift is a curse, forget the earth, he\\'s got the urge \\n To pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the whole universe \\n I\\'m not afraid \\n (I\\'m not afraid) \\n to take a stand \\n (to take a stand) \\n Everybody \\n (everybody) \\n , come take my hand \\n (come take my hand) \\n We\\'ll walk this road together, through the storm \\n Whatever weather, cold or warm \\n Just lettin\\' you know that, you\\'re not alone \\n Holla if you feel like you\\'ve been down the same road \\n OK quit playin\\' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap \\n I shouldn\\'t have to rhyme these words in a rhythm, for you to know it\\'s a rap \\n You said you was king, you lied through your teeth, for that \\n Fuck your feelin\\'s, instead of gettin\\' crowned you\\'re gettin\\' capped \\n And to the fans, I\\'ll never let you down again, I\\'m back \\n I promise to never go back on that promise, in fact \\n Let\\'s be honest, that last Relapse CD was eh \\n Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground \\n Relax, I ain\\'t goin\\' back to that now \\n All I\\'m tryna say is get back, click-clack-bloww \\n \\'Cause I ain\\'t playin\\' around, there\\'s a game called circle \\n And I don\\'t know how, I\\'m way too up to back down \\n But I think I\\'m still tryin\\' to figure this crap out \\n Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn\\'t, this fuckin\\' black cloud \\n Still follows me around, but it\\'s time to exorcise these demons \\n These motherfuckers are doin\\' jumpin\\' jacks now \\n I\\'m not afraid \\n (I\\'m not afraid) \\n to take a stand \\n (to take a stand) \\n Everybody \\n (everybody) \\n , come take my hand \\n (come take my hand) \\n We\\'ll walk this road together, through the storm \\n Whatever weather, cold or warm \\n Just lettin\\' you know that, you\\'re not alone \\n Holla if you feel like, you\\'ve been down the same road \\n And I just can\\'t keep livin\\' this way \\n So startin\\' today, I\\'m breakin\\' out of this cage \\n I\\'m standin\\' up, I\\'ma face my demons \\n I\\'m mannin\\' up, I\\'ma hold my ground \\n I\\'ve had enough, now I\\'m so fed up \\n Time to put my life back together right now \\n It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me \\n Admittedly, I probably did it subliminally for you \\n So I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through \\n And don\\'t even realize what you did, believe me you \\n I been through the ringer, but they can do little to the middle finger \\n I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of \\n My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers \\n And drop dead, no more beef flingers \\n No more drama from now on, I promise \\n To focus solely on handlin\\' my responsibilities as a father \\n So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof, like my daughters and raise it \\n You couldn\\'t lift a single shingle on it \\n \\'Cause the way I feel, I\\'m strong enough to go to the club \\n Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up \\n \\'Cause I\\'m raisin\\' the bar, I shoot for the moon \\n But I\\'m too busy gazin\\' at stars, I feel amazin\\' and I\\'m not \\n I\\'m not afraid \\n (I\\'m not afraid) \\n to take a stand \\n (to take a stand) \\n Everybody \\n (everybody) \\n , come take my hand \\n (come take my hand) \\n We\\'ll

I\\'m a space-bound rocket ship and your heart\\'s the moon \\n And I\\'m aiming right at you, right at you \\n 250,000 miles on a clear night in June \\n And I\\'m aiming right at you, right at you, right at you \\n So after a year and six months, it\\'s no longer me that you want \\n But I love you so much it hurts, never mistreated you once \\n I poured my heart out to you, let down my guard, swear to God \\n I\\'ll blow my brains in your lap, lay here and die in your arms \\n Drop to my knees and I\\'m pleading, I\\'m trying to stop you from leaving \\n You won\\'t even listen so fuck it,

of \\n To let you walk up out this house and let you live \\n Tears streamed down both of my cheeks, then I let you go and just give \\n And \\'fore I put that gun to my temple, I told you this \\n And I would\\'ve did anything for you \\n To show you how much I adored you \\n But it\\'s over now, it\\'s too late to save our love \\n Just promise me you\\'ll think of me \\n Every time you look up in the sky and see a star, \\'cause I\\'m a \\n I\\'m a space-bound rocket ship and your heart\\'s the moon \\n And I\\'m aiming right at you, right at you \\n 250,000 miles on a clear night in

\\n Maybe our relationship isn\\'t as crazy as it seems \\n Maybe that\\'s what happens when a tornado meets a volcano \\n All I know is I love you too much to walk away though \\n Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk \\n Don\\'t you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk \\n Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball \\n Next time I\\'m pissed, I\\'ll aim my fist at the dry wall \\n Next time, there will be no next time, I apologize \\n Even though I know it\\'s lies, I\\'m tired of the games \\n I just want her back, I know I\\'m a liar \\n If she ever tries to fuckin\\' leave again, I\\'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire \\n Rihanna \\n : \\n Just gonna stand there and watch me burn \\n But that\\'s alright because I like the way it hurts \\n

you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both \\n Foster care, that cross you bare, few may be as heavy as yours \\n But I love you Debbie Mathers, oh what a tangled web we have, \\'cause \\n One thing I never asked was, where the fuck my deadbeat dad was \\n Fuck it, I guess he had trouble keeping up with every address \\n But I\\'dve flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus \\n Owned a collection of maps and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas \\n Someone ever moved them from me, that you could\\'ve bet your asses \\n If I had to come down the chimney dressed as Santa, kidnap \\'em \\n And although one has only met their grandma \\n Once, you pulled up in our drive one night as we were leaving to get some hamburgers \\n Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you \\n And as you left I had this, overwhelming sadness come over me \\n As we pulled off to go our separate paths, and \\n I saw your headlights as I looked back \\n And I\\'m mad I didn\\'t get the chance to \\n Thank you for being my Mom and my Dad \\n So Mom, please accept this as a tribute I wrote this on the jet \\n I guess I had to get this off my chest \\n I hope I get the chance to lay it \\'fore I\\'m dead \\n The stewardess said to fasten my seat belt, I guess we\\'re crashing \\n So if I\\'m not dreaming, I hope you get this message that I will always love you from afar \\n \\'Cause you\\'re my ma \\n I guess we are who we are \\n Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on \\n Maybe we took this too far \\n I want a new life (start over) \\n One without a cause (clean slate) \\n So I\\'m coming home tonight \\n Well no matter what the cost \\n And if the plane goes down \\n Or if the crew can\\'t wake me up \\n Well just know that I\\'m

avert a disaster, lucky, no permanent damage, \\'cause they hurt you so bad, it\\'s like they murdered your ass, and threw dirt on your casket, but you returned from the ashes, and that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline, and while you\\'re burning the past, standing at inferno and chant \\n I\\'m standin\\' in the flames \\n It\\'s a beautiful kind of pain \\n Settin\\' fire to

you\\'ve been killed inside \\n But yet you\\'re still alive which means you must survive \\n Although today you may weep because you\\'re weak and \\n Everything seems so bleek and hopeless \\n The light that you\\'re seeking, it begins to seep in \\n That\\'s the only thing keeping you from leaping off the motherfreaking deep end \\n And I\\'m pulling for you to push through this feeling \\n And with a little time that should do the healing \\n And by tomorrow you may even feel so good that you\\'re willing \\n To forgive them even after all that shit you been put through \\n This feeling of resilience is building and the flames are burning \\n Quick as fire would through this building, you\\'re sealed in \\n But you\\'re fireproof and flame retardant you withstood it \\n And as you climb up to the roof you\\'re just chillin\\' and you look down \\n \\'Cause you\\'re so over them you could put the heel of your foot through the ceiling \\n As time passes, things change everyday \\n But wounds, wounds heal \\n But scars still remaining the same \\n But tomorrow today\\'s gone down in flames \\n Throw the match at the past up place \\n So feel the fire beneath your feet \\n As you barely even perspire from the heat \\n Exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief \\n And as you say goodbye to the grief \\n It\\'s like watching the walls melt in your prison cell \\n But you\\'ve extinguished this living hell \\n Still a little piece of you dies, you scream \\n I\\'m standin\\' in the flames \\n It\\'s a beautiful kind of pain \\n Settin\\' fire to yesterday \\n Find the light, find the light, find the light \\n I\\'m standin\\' in the flames \\n It\\'s a beautiful kind of pain \\n Settin\\' fire to yesterday \\n Find the light, find the light, find the lightt \\n Feel the burn, watch the smoke as I turn \\n Rising, a phoenix from the flames \\n Flame of love, we\\'re going to fight the word, fight \\n Now it feels with these wings that I will fly \\n I\\'m standin\\' in the flames \\n It\\'s a beautiful kind of pain \\n Settin\\' fire to yesterday \\n Find the light, find the light, find the light \\n I\\'m standin\\' in the flames \\n It\\'s a

Did you ever lay down, take a nap and loose it? \\n I dreamt I was stuck in this game called Rap Music \\n I started off underground in a dark room \\n With a freestyle, a sawed-off pump and a harpoon \\n That transform to a pen in case of a words war \\n And opened the first door that led to the first floor \\n I got attacked by a couple of rap acts \\n They wore dreads, these army pants and these backpacks \\n I hit one over the head with a broken verb \\n The muthafucka tried to hit me with some spoken word \\n But it didn\\'t work, and I finished him and his boys \\n And disappeared from the scene without makin\\' a noise \\n I used up four bars but I earned a punchline \\n And proceeded to Level 2: Land of the Unsigned \\n We don\\'t play those games \\n Would you listen here? \\n What I\\'m doin\\' he\\'re? \\n Get me outta here \\n We don\\'t play those games \\n This is gettin\\' wild \\n Can you tell me how? \\n Let me out now \\n We don\\'t play those games \\n How\\'d I get in here? \\n Let me outta here \\n What I\\'m doin\\' here? \\n We don\\'t play those games \\n This is no fun \\n Got me on the run \\n Rap 2K1 \\n I got attacked right away when I walked in \\n By a four-foot manager with a contract and a pen \\n I put up my force shield to block any attempt \\n At this shrimp drainin\\' my life twenty percent \\n The floor opened up and I almost fell inside \\n But I used my mic right, I swung to the other side \\n And just when I thought I avoided the booby trap \\n I got slapped by a female MC with a doobie rag \\n And this chick was tryin\\' to be herd like she raised cattle \\n But I remembered somethin\\' I seen on the Blaze Battle \\n Whoever sold you them shoes, they fooled you \\n I killed her with a verse about her fucked up weave and her fake FUBU \\n A record exec then appeared in a black limo \\n And started to attack with a bag full of wack demos \\n And I will admit: it was hard as hell to kill \\n So I stabbed him with an invoice and a studio bill \\n I made it to the next level: Above Ground \\n My soundscanner then picks up on this bug sound \\n I pull out the sawed-off pump and I get it cocked \\n And that\\'s when this A&R crawled from under a rock \\n And start shootin\\' opinions, I stop, drop and I roll \\n \\'Cause if they was to hit me, they\\'d penetrate to my soul \\n I hid behind some trees and I held my weapon tightly \\n His street team was up on the roof tryin\\' to snipe me \\n It took a while to finish \\'em all but I finally did it \\n Then out comes this powerful beast known as the critic \\n With a fully loaded magazine and mad drama \\n My harpoon shots just bounced off of his armor \\n Now I wish I would\\'ve stayed down in the dark caves \\n I\\'m runnin\\' towards these big-ass fans with these sharp blades \\n But he was right behind me holdin\\' a flame thrower \\n So I jumped through the blades and I died, game over\\n Shady Records ain\\'t nobody better than us \\n Shady Records no

What\\'s been up, man? How\\'s you\\'re daughter? \\n My girlfriend\\'s pregnant, too, I\\'m about to be a father. \\n If I have a daughter, guess what I\\'ma call her? \\n I\\'ma name her Bonnie. \\n I read about your Uncle Ronnie, too. I\\'m sorry. \\n I had a friend kill himself over some chick who didn\\'t want him. \\n I know you probably hear this everyday, but I\\'m your biggest fan. \\n I even got the underground stuff you did with Scam. \\n I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man. \\n I like the stuff you did with Ruckus, too.

I hope you get a chance. \\n I ain\\'t mad.

He\\'s only six years old. \\n We waited in the blistering cold for you. \\n 4 hours and you just said \"No\". \\n That\\'s pretty crummy, man.

That\\'s kinda how this is. You coulda saved me from drowning. \\n Now it\\'s too late, I\\'m on a thousand downers, now. I\\'m drowsy\\' and all I wanted was a lousy \\n Letter or a call. \\n I hope you know I ripped ALL you\\'re pictures off the wall. \\n I love you, Slim. We coulda been together; think about it. \\n You\\'ve ruined it, now. I hope you can\\'t sleep and you dream about it \\n And when you dream, I hope you can\\'t sleep and you SCREAM about it. \\n I hope you\\'re conscience EATS at you and you can\\'t BREATHE without me! \\n See Slim,(backround screaming) Shut up, slut! I\\'m tryin\\' to talk! \\n Hey Slim, that\\'s my girlfriend screamin\\' in the trunk, \\n But I didn\\'t slit her throat. I just tied her up.

How\\'m I supposed to send this tape out?! \\n (Car tires squeal, CRASH, a brief silence, A LOUD splash) \\n (Eminem as Slim Shady) \\n Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner, but I just been busy \\n You said you\\'re girlfriend\\'s pregnant, now. How far along is she? \\n Look, I\\'m really flattered you\\'d call you\\'re daughter that. \\n And here\\'s an autograph for Matthew. I wrote it on the Starter cap. \\n I\\'m sorry I didn\\'t see you at the show. I musta missed you. \\n Don\\'t think I did that stuff intenionally just to diss you. \\n But what\\'s this you said about you like to cut you\\'re wrists, too? \\n I say that stuff just clownin\\', dogg. C\\'mon, how messed up is you? \\n You got some issues, Stan. I think you need some councelin\\' \\n To help your butt from bouncin\\' off the walls when you get down some. \\n And what\\'s this about us meant to be together? \\n That type of junk will make me not want us to meet each other. \\n I really think you and your girlfriend need each other \\n Or maybe you just need to treat her better. \\n I hope you get to read this letter. I just hope it reaches you in time before you hurt yourself. I think you\\'ll be doin\\' just fine \\n If you relax a little. I\\'m glad I inspire you, but Stan, \\n Why are you so mad? Try to understand that I do want you as a fan. \\n I just don\\'t want you to do some crazy stuff. \\n I saw this one thing on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick. \\n Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge and had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid. \\n And in the car they found a tape, but they didn\\'t say who it was to. \\n Come to think about it.

But yet I\\'m still unsigned, havin\\' a rough time \\n Sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes \\n Go to work and serve MC\\'s in the lunchline \\n But when it comes crunch time, where do my punchlines go \\n Who must I show, to bust my flow \\n Where must I go, who must I know \\n Or am I just another crab in the bucket \\n \\'Cause I ain\\'t havin\\' no luck with this little Rabbit so fuck it \\n Maybe I need a new outlet, I\\'m startin to doubt shit \\n I\\'m feelin\\' a little skeptical who I hang out with \\n I look like a bum, yo my clothes ain\\'t about shit \\n At the Salvation Army tryin\\' to salvage an outfit \\n And it\\'s cold, tryin\\' to travel this road \\n Plus I feel like I\\'m on stuck in this battlin mode \\n My defenses are so up, but one thing I don\\'t want \\n Is pity from no one, the city is no fun \\n There is no sun, and it\\'s so dark \\n Sometimes I feel like I\\'m just bein pulled apart \\n From each one of my limbs, by each on of my friends \\n It\\'s enough to just make me wanna jump out of my skin \\n Sometimes I feel like a robot, sometimes I just know not \\n What I\\'m doin\\' I just blow, my head is a stove top \\n I just explode, the kettle gets so hot \\n Sometimes my mouth just overloads the ass that I don\\'t got \\n But I\\'ve learned, it\\'s time for me to you-turn \\n Yo it only takes one time for me to get burned \\n Ain\\'t no fallin\\' no next time I meet a new girl \\n I can no longer play stupid or be immature \\n I got every ingredient, all I need is the courage \\n Like I already got the beat, all I need is the words \\n Got the urge, suddenly it\\'s a surge \\n Suddenly a new burst of energy is occurred \\n Time to show these free world leaders the three and a third \\n I am no longer scared now, I\\'m free as a bird \\n Then I turn and cross over the median curb \\n Hit the \\'burbs and all you see is a blur from 8 Mile Road \\n I\\'m a man, I\\'ma make a new plan \\n Time for me to just

little nutty and I know it \\n But if you go back and take a look at my history \\n You will see that I\\'m not the only one who\\'s off his rocker \\n There were many before me \\n I was always labelled the black sheep of the family \\n What a bad seed I grow to be \\n But if you take a look at us now \\n You\\'ll see the apple didn\\'t fall too far from the tree \\n (Haha) \\n All right, look \\n I\\'ma tell you the story from my side \\n Maybe you\\'ll understand \\n Check it out \\n You done witnessed unexplainable shit \\n Too insane to explain \\n People run from what the just don\\'t get \\n Maybe shady shoulda just hit \\'em with a little bit \\n Did I spit too soon? should I of spoon fed \\'em it? \\n But I was just so eager to prove I was even worth \\n Being in the same league or the room with \\n Of the people of whom I was in \\n Every now and then I look up like I was seeking approval \\n Was it because of the pigment of my skin \\n Or was it a figment of my imagination \\n Maybe it bothered me more than it did them \\n Maybe it wasn\\'t a big deal back then \\n But to me it was, see what it was was \\n I had developed the complex from being judged \\n Proof spit his verse, now I\\'m next, let\\'s see who (?) \\n I\\'m in the booth staring back to see who\\'s mugs \\n I get a reaction from, usually the first thumb (?) was from proof \\n And the rest of the group backed him up \\n And no one lied to each other cause none of us had deals \\n It was real, we just wanted tickets for that meal \\n Sometimes I feel like it\\'s just me \\n Sometimes I feel like I\\'m going crazy \\n But take a look at my family \\n Cause the apple don\\'t fall too far from the tree \\n I said... \\n Sometimes I feel like it\\'s just me \\n Sometimes I feel like I\\'m going crazy \\n But take a look at my family \\n Cause the apple don\\'t fall too far from the tree \\n Ever since my mother was pregnant \\n With her second egg \\'cause she said \\n That I had a baby sister who fell out of the window \\n I was too young to remember \\n Kansas city projects \\n I was like 5, 6, and how come \\n I remember malcolm, isaac, and boogie \\n If it was the projects in missouri? \\n Cause those\\'re my best friends until isaac \\n Took my tricycle and my uncle todd went to try to go get it back \\n And ended up getting jumped and cut in the gut with a switch and 70-some stitches \\n Which is still, to this day \\n Why my mother still tries to show me some old fake picture \\n Of a fictitious little sister who never existed \\n And this is why part of my life\\'s so twisted \\n But I can never be as sick as that bitch is \\n And, by the way, that picture\\'s one of my relatives \\n Sometimes I feel like it\\'s just me \\n Sometimes I feel like I\\'m going crazy \\n But take a look at my family \\n Cause the apple don\\'t fall too far from the tree \\n I said... \\n Sometimes I feel like it\\'s just me \\n Sometimes I feel like I\\'m going crazy \\n But take a look at my family \\n Cause the apple don\\'t fall too far from the tree \\n You probably have to peel back layers upon layers of pain \\n To see why everything I say is so insane \\n What\\'s different about my brain \\n That separates me from other players in this game? \\n On the surface, it may seem like a scheme \\n Or some sort of scam for me to get some damn sympathy \\n But that\\'s the last thing I need is for people \\n To walk around feeling sorry for me (me) \\n And I\\'m not a g, never claimed to be \\n I gave my vest to cashis, just hope he \\n Don\\'t need it more than me \\n But we\\'ll see, \\'cause we ain\\'t lookin\\' for beef \\n But if it comes our way, what do we, turn the other cheek? \\n Come on \\n Sometimes I feel like it\\'s just me \\n Sometimes I feel like I\\'m going crazy \\n But take a look at my family \\n Cause the apple don\\'t fall too far from the tree \\n I said... \\n Sometimes I feel like it\\'s just me \\n Sometimes I feel like I\\'m going crazy \\n But take a look at my family \\n Cause the apple don\\'t fall too far from the tree\\n If I can\\'t shoot you, \\n Ima have to kill you by spittin\\', \\n Battlin mothafuckers my

Now, Dancer! Now, Prancer and Vixen! \\n On, Comet! On Cupid! On, Donder and Blitzen! \\n To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall! \\n Now dash away! dash away! dash away all!\" \\n And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof \\n The prancing and pawing of each little hoof. \\n As I drew in my hand, and was turning around, \\n Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound. \\n He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot, \\n And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot; \\n A bundle of toys he had flung on his back, \\n And he looked like a peddler just opening his pack. \\n His eyes -- how they twinkled! his dimples how merry! \\n His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry! \\n His cute little mouth was just like a bow, \\n And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow; \\n He had a broad face and a little round belly, \\n That shook, like a bowlful of jelly. \\n He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf, \\n And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself; \\n A wink of his eye and a twist of his head, \\n Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread; \\n He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work, \\n And filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk, \\n And laying his finger aside of his nose, \\n And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose; \\n He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle, \\n And away they all flew like the down of a thistle. \\n But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight, \\n \"Merry Christmas to all, and good-night.\"\\n (Old man) \\n Em could I borrow you for a little while... \\n (Eminem) \\n OK... \\n (Old man) \\n You see this book \\n (Eminem) \\n Yess, I see it \\n (Old man) \\n You touch it, it will blow you\\'re mind out, and you will become the man, you will become everything you have to be, this is you\\'re destination, you will grow up, because I know you\\'re a child right now, you\\'re about 15, 16, I think? \\n (Eminem) \\n No! not really man, I gotta go yo! just... \\n (Old man) \\n Don\\'t waist you\\'re time use it, it will blow a rap out of your mind \\n (Eminem) \\n You mean freestyle \\n (Old man) \\n No I mean the words that are in you\\'re head right now, TAKE IT! \\n (Eminem) \\n Ok, huh! shshshshshssh \\n (Eminem: rap) \\n There\\'s a difficult man, he\\'s trying to stand, he think he da man, he\\'s trying to steal my adetities he\\'s a loser, who nis he a damn witch, get him out this b**** he\\'s a guy, but I don\\'t no why, he is standin\\' in my way, I gotta go, this book is a fantasticaion, what a station, like a playstation, this book is not my destination, this book is... well! a presentaion!\\n (Eminem) \\n Ay, yo \\n This next song, is a true story \\n (Come here, bitch!) \\n Cause some things in this universe, don\\'t make sense \\n But somehow always seem to fuckin\\' work \\n VERSE ONE - Eminem \\n Driving down I-75, about to hop on 696 \\n I look over, this fucking chick\\'s tryina\\' fix her makeup, I\\'m like bitch? \\n You ain\\'t a plastic surgeon, I advise ya to put up your visor \\n I\\'m getting kinda ticked, you\\'re blocking my side mirror \\n She\\'s like yeah? so?
